test_CHZ_functions.py gives an example usage of our CHZ functions

Figure 1 was generated by running compute_sCHZ_grid.py  and then plot_sCHZ_fractions.py

Figure 2 was generated by running compute_fCHZ_grid.py then plot_fCHZ_fractions.py

Figure 3 was generated by running compute_B_grid.py then plot_B_grid.py
